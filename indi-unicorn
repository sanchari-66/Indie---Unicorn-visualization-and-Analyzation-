Collected and worked on a dataset of Indian unicorn startups (2023), including valuation, funding rounds, sectors, investors, and growth indicators.

Cleaned and preprocessed the data by handling missing values, outliers, and formatting inconsistencies for accurate analysis.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, such as top-performing sectors, funding patterns, and growth over time.

Visualized key findings using ggplot2, creating sector-wise distributions, valuation trends, and funding round comparisons.

Engineered new features to capture growth potential and investor impact on valuation.

Selected and trained multiple machine learning models (including ensemble models like Random Forest with ranger) for predictive analysis.

Evaluated models using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to ensure accuracy and robustness.

Compared the top 3â€“4 best-performing models and tuned their hyperparameters for improved predictions.

Exported the final predictive model using r2pmml for deployment and further business use cases.

Aimed to provide insights into what drives unicorn success in India and create a valuation prediction system for emerging startups.
